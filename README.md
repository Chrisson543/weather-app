# weather-app
 A weather app that gets the user's initial location using [Geoapify's](https://www.geoapify.com/) IP GeoLocation API and displays the 4-day weather forecast for their location using [WeatherAPI's](https://www.weatherapi.com/) forecast API.
 
 The user can select another location and view its weather forecast. The search bar on the popup uses [WeatherAPI's](https://www.weatherapi.com/) search/autocomplete API to show autocomplete suggestions. The selected location's 4-day weather forecast is then gotten again using [WeatherAPI's](https://www.weatherapi.com/) forecast API.
